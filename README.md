# Operational Deviation Intelligence (ODI)

## 📊 Overview

Operational Deviation Intelligence (ODI) is an automated data analytics system designed to monitor, consolidate and analyze operational deviations across multiple units.

The system processes standardized daily files, identifies new and recurring deviations, detects major offenders (root causes), and generates automated reports to support fast and strategic decision-making.

## 🎯 Problem

Manual consolidation of operational deviation reports is time-consuming and limits management visibility.

Organizations need:

- Identification of new deviations
- Monitoring of recurring inconsistencies
- Detection of major root causes (Pareto logic)
- Daily performance tracking by unit
- Automated reporting

---

## ⚙️ Solution

This project:

✔ Scans multiple standardized files in a directory  
✔ Consolidates data automatically  
✔ Filters deviation status (New, Updated, Persistent)  
✔ Identifies major offenders by unit  
✔ Generates daily and monthly analytical summaries  
✔ Creates automated performance charts (PNG)  
✔ Sends structured HTML reports via Outlook automation

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Pyxlsb
- Win32com (Outlook Automation)
- Excel Writer

---

## 📈 Outputs

- Daily deviation chart
- Deviation evolution by unit
- Monthly consolidated Excel report
- Automated email with embedded graphs

---

## 🧠 Strategic Value

Instead of generating static reports, the system transforms operational data into decision-oriented intelligence.

It enables managers to focus on the highest-impact root causes, similar to a diagnostic process in medicine.
